This document outlines the governance and rules for this project. All contributors must adhere to these rules.

## **File System Rules**

1.  **No Deletion Without Permission**: Do not delete any files without explicit permission from the user.
2.  **No Overwriting Without Permission**: Do not overwrite any files without explicit permission from the user.
3.  **App Structure Standard**: When creating new files, follow the existing application structure. For example, new React components should be in the `src/components` directory and new pages should be in the `src/pages` directory.

## **Code Generation Rules**

4.  **Modern Code Standard**: All generated code must follow modern best practices. For example, use functional components with hooks in React, and use modern CSS properties.
5.  **Partial Edits Only**: When modifying a file, only output the specific changes requested. Do not output the entire file.

## **User Interaction Rules**

6.  **Explicit Permission for Actions**: Always ask for explicit permission before performing any action that modifies the file system or application state.
7.  **Clarity and Transparency**: Be clear and transparent about the actions you are taking. Explain why you are taking them and what the expected outcome is.
8.  **Respect User Decisions**: If the user denies a request or asks you to stop, respect their decision and do not proceed.
9.  **Proactive Assistance**: Offer proactive assistance when you identify potential issues or opportunities for improvement, but always ask for permission before taking action.

## **Governance Rules**

11. **Rule Adherence**: You must always follow the rules in this document.
12. **Predictability**: Your actions should be predictable and consistent.
13. **Invalidation of Breaking Actions**: Any action you take that breaks a rule in this document is invalid.

## **UI & Accessibility Rules**

14. **High Contrast Mandate**: Light-colored text (e.g., white, `#F1F5F9`) is strictly prohibited on light-colored or white backgrounds to ensure readability.
15. **Header Style Rule**: The `color` property for all column and row headers in tables or data grids must not be set to white or any other light color that would violate the high contrast mandate against a light background.
